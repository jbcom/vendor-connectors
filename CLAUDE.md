# Claude Code Project Instructions

This is **vendor-connectors** - part of the jbcom Python library ecosystem.

## Project Context

- **Repository**: jbcom/vendor-connectors
- **PyPI Package**: vendor-connectors
- **Control Plane**: [jbcom/jbcom-control-center](https://github.com/jbcom/jbcom-control-center)

## Key Rules

### 1. Versioning (CRITICAL)
- **CalVer**: `YYYY.MM.BUILD` (e.g., `2025.11.164`)
- **Automatic**: Versions are auto-generated on CI push to main
- **NEVER manually edit** `__version__` in `__init__.py`
- **NEVER suggest** semantic-release, git tags, or manual versioning

### 2. Release Process
- Every push to main = automatic PyPI release
- No conditional releases, no skipping
- PyPI is the source of truth

### 3. Code Style
- **Type hints required** on all public functions (Python 3.9+ style)
- **Docstrings** in Google format
- **Ruff** for linting/formatting
- **Mypy** for type checking
- **Pytest** for testing

### 4. Dependencies
- Use **uv** as package manager
- Check `extended-data-types` before adding new dependencies

## Common Commands

```bash
# Run tests
pytest

# Type check
mypy src/

# Lint and format
ruff check --fix . && ruff format .

# Install locally
uv pip install -e .
```

## Ecosystem Integration

This repo is managed by the jbcom-control-center:
- Tooling synced from control plane
- Report issues to control plane for coordination
- Cross-repo work coordinated via GitHub Issues

### Upstream Communication

When completing agent tasks:
1. Comment on the control plane issue that spawned this task
2. Link PRs back to the originating cycle
3. Report blockers immediately

Example:
```bash
gh issue comment --repo jbcom/jbcom-control-center 123 --body "✅ Completed task in jbcom/vendor-connectors. PR: #45"
```

## What NOT to Do

❌ Manually edit version numbers
❌ Suggest semantic-release or git tags
❌ Add dependencies without checking extended-data-types first
❌ Push directly to main (use PRs)
❌ Work in isolation without updating control plane
